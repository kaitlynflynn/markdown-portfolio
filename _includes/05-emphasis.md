Hi, I'm **Kaitlyn Flynn**, a full stack web developer based in Woodinville, WA. I have always been a firm believer in *being the change you want to see in this world*, so my natural response to seeing a lack of diversity in STEM is to roll my sleeves up and become a positive force for change. I love problem solving, pair programming and creating web applications.

I specialize in front end developement with extensive knowledge in system administration, office management, Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite with experience in back end development.
